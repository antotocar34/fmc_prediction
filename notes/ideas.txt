Questions to Answer:
-------------------

- What is the specific research/project question.
- Where to get plant characteristics?
- 

Things to Do:

-Ensure that these predictions of LFMC are actually useful.
-


Ideas:

-Plants can be categoirzed into so called high-responding and low-responding which reflects their correlation to seasonal variation 
or immediate rainfall. Broadly speaking drought indices/meteorological data appears to generate decent predictions of around = 0.8 (see spanish study)
But, the spatial variance and especially the results for low-responding plants are much poorer as suggested by the evaluation of drought indices article.
That article also suggests that improvements can be made with more mechanistic indices that take into account plant traits (such as low responding plants 
having longer roots), local parametrization of soil characteristics, vegetation cover, etc. More mechanistic drought index is potentially RWC.

-Drought indices are usually just calculated in some way from meteorological data.
