This repository contains the code that scrapes, cleans and analyses data for Antoine Carnec and Clinton Leung's project for the Statistical Inference class as part of a masters degree in Data Science Methodology at the Barcelona School of Economics.

In this project, we wanted to create a novel dataset in order to predict live fuel moisture content (a key indicator of wildfire risk). We combined metereological data, data on plant characteristics and remote sensing data.
